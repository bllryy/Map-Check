# Map-Check
Downloads MCSR practice maps

# Usage
Run the jar file and select instances, to select multiple you can use ctrl or shift. You only need to select the instance directory, **not saves or .minecraft**.

Select the maps you want and press download.

If u have any issues or suggestions you can dm me on discord. @cylorun

You can add your other maps that are not in it by default by adding their download link(.zip) to the "Custom map" box and pressing add.
Also it does not like google download links, they are just annoying and long as fuck and don't use them
